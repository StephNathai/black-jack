Welcome to Black Jack!

Please find the rules as follows:
HOW TO PLAY

1) The dealer and each player get two cards. The dealer's first card faces up, the second faces down. Face cards each count as 10, Aces count as 1 or 11, all others count at face value. Any First 2 cards with an Ace with any 10, Jack, Queen, or King is a "Blackjack."

2) If you have a Blackjack, the dealer pays you one-and-a-half times your bet - unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case it's a "push" and neither wins.

3) If you don't have a Blackjack, you can ask the dealer to "hit" you by using a scratching motion with your fingers on the table.

4) You may draw as many cards as you like (one at a time), but if you go over 21, you "bust" and lose. If you do not want to "hit," you may "stand" by making a side-to-side waving motion with your hand.

5) After all players are satisfied with their hands, the dealer will turn his or her down card face up and stand or draw as necessary.
